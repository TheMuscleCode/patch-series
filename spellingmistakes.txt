I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local primary
school. I then went to the local secondary school and received grades in
English, Maths, Physics, Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical Communication and
Philosophy of Religion. I'll not bore you with the 'A' levels and above.
Notice the ambigious English qualification above. It was, in truth, a course
dedicated to reading "Lord of the Flies" and other gems, and a weak attempt at
getting us to comprehend them. Luckily, my middle-class upbringing gave me a
head start as I was already acquainted with that sort of language these books
used (and not just the Peter and Jane books) and had read similar books before.
I will never be able to put that particular course down as much as I desire to
because, for all its faults, it introduced me to Steinbeck, Malkovich and the
wonders of Lenny, mice and pockets. My education never included one iota of
grammar. Lynne Truss points out in "Eats, shoots and leaves" that many people
were excused from the rigours of learning English grammar during their
schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority of decision-makers
decided one day that it might hinder imagination and expression (so what, I
ask, happened to all those expressive and imaginative people before the
ruling?)
